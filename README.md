# Custom Switch


## Description

This project presents an attractive UI element in the form of a custom switch created using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The switch is designed to provide a unique and interactive look to your web page. The design, however, is not my own creation but was crafted by the talented designer uxbly.


## Key Features

**Smooth Animation:** The switch comes with smooth animations to enhance the user experience.

**Structured Code:** SCSS writing follows the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) principle, ensuring a clear and maintainable code structure.


## Compile SCSS

Use the following command to compile SCSS files into CSS.

```bash
sass assets/scss/style.scss assets/css/style.css
```
